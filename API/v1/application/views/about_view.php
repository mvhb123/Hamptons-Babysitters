			<h2>Sitter Expectations</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When you accept a job, it is your responsibility to keep track
					of the date and time you are scheduled for. (Sitters need to check
					the actual app/website, not just the emails in case a job was
					cancelled).</li>
				<li>Please be on time for all jobs. If you are going to be late,
					please communicate with the office and the parents.</li>
				<li>Look at the directions to the house you are sitting for ahead of
					time, and be sure to give yourself extra travel time. As you all
					may know there are many drop zones in the Hamptons, especially in
					the springs section of East Hampton, Bridgehampton and Sagaponack!</li>
				<li>Although you have your cell phone, refrain from using it! You
					should have full attention on the child you are babysitting.</li>
				<li>Always survey the house upon arrival. Is there a pool? Is there
					a fence around the pool. Can the child swim? Is the driveway on a
					hill that leads into a busy road? Where are the stairs? All pot
					handles should be turned inwards.</li>
				<li>Please be familiar with Carrie Contey’s child manual.</li>
				<li>In the event of an emergency call 911 first.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Sitter Cancellation</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>If you acquire three occurrences of cancellation, lateness, or
					any other complaints, once verified, will be met with removal from
					Hamptons Babysitters.</li>
				<li>In other words, please let us know if you find yourself in the
					following circumstances: If you are not feeling well earlier in the
					day (the sooner we know, the easier we can find a replacement). If
					you are going to be late because of traffic or getting off from
					another job later than expected.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Extra Children/Chores</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>If there are more children than scheduled but there is another
					nanny or babysitter watching them, then you are only responsible
					for the children of the clients. However, if that other
					nanny/sitter leaves at any time and the children are under your
					care, let us know so you can be paid accordingly.</li>
				<li>There is a place in the app where you can add another child, but
					only add the child if you are watching the child.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Please keep in mind that you are hired for childcare purposes only.
				While working, you are only required to complete tasks related to
				the care of the child/children. You are not hired to complete any
				additional tasks that do not pertain to the direct care of the
				children, such as laundry, extra cleaning, or other household
				chores. In other words, you are not hired to complete tasks for the
				whole family, just for the children. <br> <br>If you find yourself
				in a situation where a client is asking you to complete tasks that
				are not related to the care of the child/children, please let the
				agency know as soon as possible. If a client asks you to complete a
				task or chore that does not directly pertain to the child/children
				you are currently watching, please remind them that you are only
				being paid to take care of the children and if they have any
				questions they are more than welcome to contact the agency. <br> <br>“Extra”
				cleaning and other small tasks may not seem like a big deal at
				first, but keep in mind that once you say you will do it the clients
				will most likely continue to ask you to do more and more, which puts
				you in an uncomfortable situation. <br> <br>Our clients are well
				aware that you are hired for childcare purposes only and they are
				not to encourage you/ask you to complete any additional work that is
				unrelated to your childcare duties. Therefore, it is perfectly
				acceptable for you to remind clients of your duties in a respectful
				and polite manner!
			</p>

			<h2>Contract (Sitters cannot sit for clients outside of the agency,
				ever!)</h2>

			<p>
				In accordance with the contract both clients and sitters have
				signed, you may not accept any offers to work for clients outside of
				assigned jobs with Hamptons Babysitters. This is considered a breach
				of contract and you will be terminated and legal action will be
				taken. <br> <br>“Sitter shall contact Employing Families through
				Agency only and may only accept additional work requests from
				Employing Families through Agency. At no time may a sitter solicit
				work from Employing Families that are registered with Agency during
				the term of this Agreement.” <br> <br>“Theft of Services. Violation
				of this provision shall constitute a Theft of Services and result in
				Sitter to a $500 charge in liquidated damages. THE PARTIES AGREE
				THAT THE DAMAGES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
				AND NOT PENALTIES AND THAT THEY ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE HARM
				THAT WILL BE CAUSED BY ANY CLAIM, THE DIFFICULTIES OF PROOF OF LOSS,
				AND THE INCONVENIENCE AND INFEASIBILITY OF OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN
				ADEQUATE REMEDY.”
			</p>

			<h2>Please Wear Appropriate Attire</h2>
			<p>
				Sitters are expected to be well groomed and appropriately dressed at
				all times. Clothing and shoes should be comfortable and suitable for
				working with children. Dress appropriately for all weather
				conditions, as a parent/guardian may request that you take a child
				outdoors and inappropriate dress should not inhibit this
				possibility. Sitters are role models. We strive to project a
				professional image to parents/guardians and children. All sitters
				are expected to maintain an appearance that reflects positively on
				Hamptons Babysitters and is appropriate for working with young
				children. <br> <br> Although we want you to be relaxed and
				comfortable, and certainly don’t want you to ruin any special
				clothes with paint or glue, it is important for you to dress in a
				professional manner while sitting. Casual clothing such as t-shirts
				and jeans are generally appropriate if they are neat and clean.
				Ripped, torn, overly worn and/or dirty clothing is not to be worn
				while sitting. <br> <br> The following are examples of clothing
				found inappropriate for sitters to wear during a job:<br> <br>
				Exposed undergarments<br> Low-cut tops exposing cleavage<br> Bare
				midriff or half shirts<br> Bedroom attire, such as pajama bottoms<br>
				See-through clothing<br> Short shorts<br> Mini skirts<br> Attire
				with messages or illustrations that are obscene, vulgar, violent
				and/or advertise alcohol or other products which laws prohibit
				minors from using.
